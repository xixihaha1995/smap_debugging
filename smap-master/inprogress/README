Getting this to work
1) run smap-monitize for isone.ini
1.5) change paths where necessary
2) overwrite the conf file in /etc/monit/conf.d/

isone is the monit config file, goes in /etc/monit/conf.d/
smap-status.py takes in 3 args, checks feed status, and returns an exit code
testwrapper.sh is a wrapper that I guess we'll need to generate for each driver
because monit won't let me put arguments for smap-status in the config file

NOTE: this setup is purposefully controlling the wrong driver. For testing 
purposes it is checking the feed for the MIso driver but controlling the IsoNE 
driver (so that I can shut MIso on/off manually and see monit's repsonse)
