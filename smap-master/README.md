## Getting Started

### Installation

To setup a clean environment, create a new python virtual environment with:

    virtualenv venv

Before proceeding with installation, make sure you've sourced the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.

You must install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` before installing smap. Do this by issuing the following:

    pip install -r osx_requirements.txt

After the dependencies are installed, run the installation:

    python setup.py install
