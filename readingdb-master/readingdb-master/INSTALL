Building and running the readingdb server
=========================================

Build this project using automake as usual:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

This installs the `reading-server` binary.  By default, it places the
database volumes in /var/lib/readingdb.  You can change it using an
option to `configure`, or by passing a command-line argument.

The install process also installs a monit script in /etc/monit/conf.d
which can be used to start and stop the server if you have monit
installed; a `monit start readingdb` will work.

reading-server will attempt to drop to a "readingdb" user when
started; this is convenient since monit often runs as root.  If you
want this to happen, you'll need to create this user (for instance, by
doing `adduser --system readingdb`) if you are not using the binary
package.  You'll have to make sure that the data directory is readable
and writable by this user if you do this.

Building and installing the python bindings
===========================================

In order to connect to the database, you'll need the python libraries.
They must be installed separately:

$ cd iface_bin
$ sudo make install

This will build and install the python bindings in your system-wide
python install.
