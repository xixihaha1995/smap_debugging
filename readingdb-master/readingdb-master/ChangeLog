	* multi.c: add file with parallel downloader.

	* readingdb.i: change/break client API.  db_setup() is now required to
	set connection params; whole query api is db_prev/db_next/db_query.
	Auto connects and returns lists of numpy matrices (creating them in
	python was really slow).

	* compress.c (val_compress, val_decompress): remove btree
	compression routines and replace with these since we're moving
	compression external to the library.

	* util-db.c (get, put, get_partial): enable compression before
	writing page to bdb.  This changes the on-disk format.

	* reading-server.c (start_threads, deadlock_thread,
	checkpoint_thread): start deadlock detector, checkpointer, and
	archiver in-process to avoid the need for external scripts.

	* compress.c: add file with compression routines.  Use combined
	delta-encoding + huffman tree from zlib.

	* reading-server.c (process_request, process_pbuf): switch to
	using google protocol buffers for wire format.  deprecate and
	disable ascii protocol.

	* reading-server.c: Finally enable transaction updates to
	hopefully get rid of data losses.
