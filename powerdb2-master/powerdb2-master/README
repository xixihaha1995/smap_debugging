powerdb2 Frontend
=================

powerdb2 provides a plotting interface on top of time series data
loaded into a sMAP archive.  To install, first configure a database
for django to use; sqlite3 works fine for a small installation:

DATABASES = {
    'default' : {
        'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME' : 'smapdb',
        }

If your archiver is running locally, you are are done; otherwise, edit
ARD_URL to point to your remote archiver.  To try a system with a lot
of data, feel free to point yourself at:

ARD_URL = 'http://ar2.openbms.org:8079'

Once you've done this, you need to run two django commands to
initialize your install:

$ python manage.py collectstatic
$ python manage.py syncdb

You will want to create a superuser while doing this.

Finally, you should be able to run your local copy of the frontend
using:

$ python manage.py runserver
