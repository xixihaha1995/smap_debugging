 Things in this directory should be "packages".  This application is
 currently called smap so you can put your shit in there and reference
 the library components.

 For stuff like jquery, include a version number in the path so we can
 host multiple versions -- sometimes this is important so we don't
 accidently break something.

 package
  js
  html
  css
